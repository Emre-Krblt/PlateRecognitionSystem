To train our model we used dataset from kaggle that reachable using the link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection?resource=download .


In the folder there is already trained model. And that model implemented in PlateRecognitionPredict.py file that gave you change to make predictions.

Also you can train your model using PlateRecognitionModelTrain.py as well.
